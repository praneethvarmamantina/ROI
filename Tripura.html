<p class="rivers">
The State of Tripura is well endowed with surface water resources. 
As many as ten major rivers is reported to generate an annual flow of 
793 million cubic meter of water. All rivers are rain-fed and ephemeral in nature.
 All major rivers originate from hill ranges and show a typical drainage pattern called
 trelis, except a few instances of dendrite pattern.

The State of Tripura borders with Bangladesh and the Indian states of Assam and Mizoram. The third-smallest state in India and also a princely state till 1949, It covers an area of 10,491 square kilometres (4,051 sq mi). The area of modern Tripura was ruled for several centuries by the Tripuri dynasty. It was a princely state during British rule, and joined the newly independent India. Ethnic strife between the indigenous people and Bengali population led to tension and scattered violence since its integration into the country, but the establishment of an autonomous tribal administrative agency and other strategies have led to peace. Tripura was divided into four districts but with effect from 21 January 2012 four more new districts was divided making a total of eight districts in the state.

<button class="accordion">Transport</button>

<div class="panel">

<h2>Airways</h2>
 
<p class=="airways">
 
Agartala Airport, located 12 km northwest of Agartala at Singerbhil, 
is the second busiest airport in northeast India after Guwahati.
 There are direct flights to Kolkata, Imphal, Delhi, Shillong,
 Guwahati, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Mumbai. The major 
 airlines are Air India and Indigo Airlines. Passenger helicopter
 services are available between the capital and major towns 
 (Kailashahar, Dharmanagar) as well as to more remote areas 
 such as Kanchanpur, Belonia and Gandacherra.

 
 
 </p>

<h2>Railways</h2>
 
 <p class="railways">
 
Agartala, came on India's railway map with the advent of the railways in
 the subcontinent in 1853 but the link was broken when India was partitioned in 1947.
 Railway service was established in Tripura in 1964 by constructing 1,000 mm metre gauge 
 track from Lumding in Assam to Dharmanagar and Kailasahar in Tripura but the track did 
 not connect the state capital Agartala. Rail transport was absent in the state until 2008-09
 when the railway track was extended to the capital Agartala.
 The metre gauge rail track was connected to 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) 
 broad gauge at Lumding. The major railway stations in this line are 
 in Agartala, Dharmanagar, and Kumarghat. This metre gauge track was converted
 to 1,676 mm (5 ft 6 in) broad gauge in 2016 and now trains run from
 Agartala to Calcutta and Delhi. The total length of this railway 
 track in Tripura state is 153 km. It is a single line without electrification. 
Extension of the railway line from Agartala to the southernmost
 town of Sabroom at Bangladesh border is in progress. The 43 km 
 long track from Agartala to Udaipur-Tripura railway 
 station (station code UDPU) near Mata Tripura Sundari Temple has 
 been commissioned and two trains run on this section. The 70 km
 long section from Udaipur-Tripura to Sabroom on
 the bank of Feni River, which separates Tripura from Bangladesh, is being constructed as of 2017. 

 A new railway line is being laid westwards from Agartala to 
 Akhaura in Bangladesh. This will reduce the distance between Agartala and Calcutta by over 1000 km and provide rail access to Chittagong port. 


<h2>Roadways</h2>
 

 <p class="roadways">
 
Only one major road, the National Highway 8 (NH-8),
 connects Tripura to the rest of India. Starting at 
 Sabroom in southern Tripura, it heads north to the capital
 Agartala, turns east and then north-east to 
 enter the state of Assam. Locally known as "Assam Road", the NH-8
 is often called the lifeline of Tripura.
 However, the highway is single lane and of poor quality;
 often landslides, rains or other disruptions on the highway cut
 the state off from its neighbours. Another National Highway, NH 108, 
 connects the town Panisagar in North Tripura District with Aizawl, Mizoram.
 The Tripura Road Transport Corporation is the government agency overlooking public
 transport on road. A hilly and land-locked state, Tripura is 
 dependent mostly on roads for transport.
 The total length of roads in the state is 16,931 km (10,520 mi) 
 of which national highways constitute 88 km (55 mi) and state highways 
 689 km (428 mi), as of 2009-10. Residents in rural areas frequently use waterways as a mode of transport. 
Tripura has an 856 km (532 mi) long international border with Bangladesh, 
of which 777.4 km (483.1 mi) is fenced, as of 2012. Several locations along 
the border serve as bilateral trading points between India and Bangladesh, 
such as Akhaura near Agartala, Raghna, Srimantpur, Belonia, Khowai and Kailasahar.
 A bus service exists between Agartala and Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh.
 In 2013, the two countries signed an agreement to establish a 15 km (9.3 mi) 
 railway link between Agartala and the Akhaura junction of Bangladesh.

<div class="panel">


<p class="sports">

Football and cricket are the most popular sports in the state. 
On 16 December 2018 T10 Cricket night league named
 DTL going to organise in Dharmanagar, North Tripura. 
 The state capital Agartala has its own club football 
 championships every year in which many local clubs compete in a
 league and knockout format. The Tripura cricket team participates 
 in the Ranji Trophy, the Indian domestic cricket competition. 
 The state is a regular participant of the Indian National Games
 and the North Eastern Games. In 2016, Dipa Karmakar from Agartala became 
 the first ever female gymnast from India to qualify for the Olympics 
 when she qualified for the women's artistic gymnastics event of 2016 Summer Olympics.
