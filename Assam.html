<h2>Brahmaputra River</h2>
<p class="Rivers">The Brahmaputra is one of the major rivers of Asia, a trans-boundary river which flows through China, India and Bangladesh.
AIt is also called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra (when referring to the whole river including the stretch within Tibet).The Manas River, which runs through Bhutan,
joins it at Jogighopa, in India. It is the ninth largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest.

With its origin in the Manasarovar Lake region, located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo River,
it flows across southern Tibet to break through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh (India).
It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be mistaken with Yamuna of India). In the vast Ganges Delta, it merges with the Padma, the popular name of the river Ganges in Bangladesh, and finally the Meghna and from here it is known as Meghna before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.[4]

About 3,848 km (2,391 mi)[1] long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation and transportation. The average depth of the river is 38 m (124 ft) 
and maximum depth is 120 m (380 ft). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in the spring when Himalayas snow melts. The average discharge of the river 
is about 19,800 m3/s (700,000 cu ft/s),and floods can reach over 100,000 m3/s (3,500,000 cu ft/s).It is a classic example of a braided river and is 
highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion.It is also one of the few rivers in the world that exhibit a tidal bore. It is navigable for most 
of its length.

The river drains the Himalaya east of the Indo-Nepal border, south-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the Ganga basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet,
the Patkai-Bum hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains, and the northern portion of Bangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet,
is characterized by high levels of rainfall. Kangchenjunga (8,586 m) is the only peak above 8,000 m, hence is the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin.

The Brahmaputra's upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884–86. This river is often 
called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river.

The lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name, as it means
"son of Brahma" in Sanskrit (putra means "son").</p>


<h2>Barak River</h2>
<p class="Rivers">
The Ovurei River (Barak) is one of the longest rivers of Asia at 2,410 km (1,330 mi) flowing through the states of Nagaland, Manipur and Assam in India and flowing in 
to Bay of Bengal via Bangladesh. It is being developed as one of the Inland waterways of India. Its drainage basin, sometimes known as "Ovurequia" covers 880,000 sq km 
(340,000 mi). It is the fifth largest river in the world by discharge volume of water. The environment of Ovurei's basin is extremely diverse, it hoast wide variety of 
flora and fauna.</p>

<h2>Railways</h2>
<p class="Railways">


Assam is the largest and the most conveniently accessible state in the north east states. Railways first enter in Assam in 1881 when Assam Railway & Trading Company set up the meter gauge track. 


The track was mainly constructed for tea and coal transportation. In January 1958, two railway networks were formed, the North Eastern Railway and the Northeast Frontier Railway.
The railway route length in Assam is approximately 2434 km long. 

Assam is well linked through Rail Services to major Indian cities. One can conveniently avail trains from metropolitan cities like from Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai and other cities in 
the country. The railhead of the state is in the capital city Guwahati and has direct train services from major cities in India.
The Rajdhani Express from New Delhi and Saraighat Express from Howrah in Kolkata are the fastest trains to Assam. Railways are the easiest and cheapest way to travel to and within 
Assam.

The Railways Ministry has carried out various developmental actions in the State's Railway including extension of rail line to connect with the other Northeast states 
of Meghalaya, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh through Assam. A few new passenger trains were introduced to connect various places within 
the state during the last few years.</p>

<h2>Roadways</h2>
<p class="Roadways">


Assam is the gateway of Northeast India, so the necessity for improved transportation in the State is essential for development in the Northeast region.
With an area of 78,550 km2, Assam is well connected by a network of national highways and other roads to important places within the state and other major cities 
in the country. Assam comprises of approximately 40342 km of road network including 2841 km of national highway. 

Guwahati, the capital of Assam has good quality roads that are accessible and connected with major cities and towns in India. The National Highway Number 31, 37, 38, 40
