<p class="about">

 Madhya Pradesh is a state in central India. Its capital is Bhopal, 
 and the largest city is Indore, with Jabalpur, 
 Gwalior, Ujjain and Sagar being the other major cities. 
 Nicknamed the "Heart of India" due to its geographical 
 location, Madhya Pradesh is the second largest Indian state 
 by area and the fifth largest state by population with over 
 75 million residents. It borders the states of Uttar Pradesh 
 to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the southeast, Maharashtra to 
 the south, Gujarat to the west, and Rajasthan to the northwest. 
 Its total area is 308,252 square km. Before 2000, when Chhattisgarh was 
 a part of Madhya Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh was the largest 
 state in India and the distance between the two furthest
 points inside the state, Singoli and Konta, was 1500 km. 
 Konta is presently in Sukma district of Chhattisgarh state.

<p class="rivers">

The Narmada is the longest river in Madhya Pradesh. It flows westward 
through a rift valley, with the Vindhya ranges sprawling along its 
northern bank and the Satpura range of mountains along the southern.
 Its tributaries include the Banjar, the Tawa, the Machna, the Shakkar,
 the Denwa and the Sonbhadra rivers. The Tapti River runs parallel to Narmada, 
 and also flows through a rift valley. The Narmadaâ€“Tapti systems carry an enormous 
 volume of water and provide drainage for almost a quarter of the 
 land area of Madhya Pradesh. The Narmada river is considered very 
 sacred and is worshipped throughout the region. It is the main source
 of water and acts as a lifeline to the state. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Vindhyas form the southern boundary of the Ganges basin, with the 
western part of the Ganges basin draining into the Yamuna and the eastern 
part directly into the Ganges itself. All the rivers, which drain 
into the Ganges, flow from south to north, with the Chambal, Shipra, 
Kali Sindh, Parbati, Kuno, Sind, Betwa, Dhasan and Ken rivers being the
 main tributaries of the Yamuna. Shipra River is one of the most sacred
 rivers of Hinduism. It is the site of the Simhastha Kumbh Mela, which is 
 held every 12 years. The land drained by these rivers is agriculturally rich,
 with the natural vegetation largely consisting of grass and dry deciduous forest
 types, largely thorny. The eastern part of the Ganges basin consists of the 
 Son, the Tons and the Rihand Rivers. Son, which arises in the Maikal hills
 around Amarkantak, is the largest tributary that goes into the Ganges on
 the south bank and that does not arise from the Himalayas. Son and its 
 tributaries contribute the bulk of the monsoon flow into the Ganges, because 
 the north bank tributaries are all snow fed. The forests in their basins are
 much richer than the thorn forests of the northwestern part of Madhya Pradesh. 
<br/>
<br/>
After the formation of Chhattisgarh State, the major portion of Mahanadi 
basin now lies in Chhattisgarh. Presently, only 154 square km basin area of Hasdeo
 River in Anuppur District lies in Madhya Pradesh. 
The Satpuras, in the Gawilgarh and Mahadeo Hills, also contain a watershed, 
which is south facing. The Wainganga, the Wardha, the Pench, the Kanhan rivers, 
discharge an enormous volume of water into the Godavari river system. The Godavari 
basin consists of sub-tropical, semi-moist forests, mainly in the valley of the 
Indrawati. There are many important multi-state irrigation projects in development, 
including the Godavari River Basin Irrigation Projects.
