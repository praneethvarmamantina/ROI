<button class="accordion">Rivers</button>

<div class="panel">

<h2>Chapora River</h2>

<p class="chapora">

 Chapora River is a river in northern Goa, 
 India. It runs westward into 
 the Arabian sea at Chapora and
 demarcates the border between
 the North Goa talukas of Pernem and Bardez.
 The river originates at Ramghat in the 
 neighbouring state of Maharashtra
 enters Goa and flows into the Arabian Sea.
 Vagator Beach, a tourist destination, 
 is located at the estuary to the south,
 and to the north is the village of Morjim.
 There is a bridge across Chapora from Morjim to Siolim. 
In the 18th century, the river marked 
the boundary between Portuguese Goa and India.

</p>


<h2>Mandovi River</h2>

<p class="mandovi">

The Mandovi River also known as Mahadayi or Mhadei river,
 is described as the lifeline of the Indian state 
 of Goa. The Mandovi and the Zuari are the two primary
 rivers in the state of Goa. Mandovi joins with the 
 Zuari at a common creek at Cabo Aguada, forming the 
 Mormugao harbour. Panaji, the state capital and Old Goa,
 the former 
capital of Goa, are both situated on the left bank of the Mandovi. 


</p>

<h2>Mapusa River</h2>

<p class="mapusa">


Mapusa River is a tributary of the River 
Mandovi in Goa, India. The river 
originates from the jungles of 
Dumacem and Amthane, meanders 
eastward and then southward before
 it drains itself in the Mandovi 
 river at Penha de France. Mapusa 
 River has separated Corjuem from mainland Aldona. 
The river has since ancient times been 
used a popular waterway to transport 
agricultural products and spices. The
 town of Mapusa is the largest town 
 located on the banks of the river. 

</p>

<h2>Sal River</h2>

<p class="sal">

The Sal River is a small river in Salcete,
 Goa in India. The river opens near Margao 
 and passes through the villages of Benaulim,
 Navelim, Varca, Orlim, Carmona, Dramapur,
 Chinchinim, Assolna, Cavelossim, Mobor and 
 drains itself into the Arabian Sea at Betul. 


</p>


<h2>Terekhol River</h2>

<p class="terekhol">

The Terekhol River is a river in western India. 
In its upper reaches it is known as the Banda River
 and in the lower reaches as the Terekhol. It forms 
 the boundary between Sindhudurg district of Maharashtra
 state and North Goa district of Goa state for some distance. 
 The Terekhol rises in the environs of the Manohargad in the
 Western Ghats
 and flows in a south-westerly direction to meet the Arabian Sea.



</p>


<h2>Zuari River</h2>

<p class="zuari">

The Zuari River is the largest river in the state of Goa, India. 
It is a tidal river. The Zuari originates at Hemad-Barshem
 in the Western Ghats. The Zuari is also referred to as the
 Aghanashani in the interior regions. It flows in the
 southern-western direction through the talukas of Tiswadi, 
 Ponda, Mormugao, Salcete, Sanguem and Quepem. 
Zuari is 92 km long, but is connected to other rivers 
and canals such as Mandovi river (62 km in length) and
 Cumbarjua Canal (15 km). The other rivers in Goa are 
 shorter such as Terekhol (22 km), Chapora (29 km), Baga (5 km),
 Sal (16 km), Talpona (11 km), and Galgibag (4 km).
 Their lengths and widths vary with tidal and other 
 seasonal flooding.
The Zuari and Mandovi Rivers form an estuarine system. 
They are the backbone of Goa's agricultural industry. 
The Cumbarjuem Canal linking the two rivers has enabled 
ships navigate to the interior regions to the iron ore mines.
 The waters of the Mandovi and Zuari both flush out into the 
 Arabian Sea at Cabo Aguada, a common point forming the Mormugao 
 harbour. The port 
city of (Vasco da Gama, Goa) lies on the mouth of the Zuari River.

<button class="accordion">Transport</button>

<div class="panel">

<h2>Airways</h2>

<p class="airways">

Goa International Airport, is a civil enclave
 at INS Hansa, a Naval airfield located at Dabolim
 near Vasco da Gama. The airport caters to scheduled
 domestic and international air services. Goa has 
 scheduled international connections to Doha, Dubai,
 Muscat, Sharjah and Kuwait in the Middle East by 
 airlines like Air Arabia, Air India, GoAir, Indigo,
 Oman Air, SpiceJet and Qatar Airways. Though night
 operations were not permitted till recently, 
 the military now allows civil airlines to fly 
 during the night. The proposed
 greenfield Mopa Airport will be built at Mopa in Pernem taluka.
 
</p>

<h2>Railways</h2>

<p class="railways">
Goa has two rail lines - one run by the South Western
 Railway and the other by the Konkan Railway. The line
 run by the South Western Railway was built during the
 colonial era linking the port town of Vasco da Gama,
 Goa with Belgaum, Hubli, Karnataka via Margao.
 The Konkan Railway line, which was built during 
 the 1990s, runs 
parallel to the coast connecting major cities on
 the western coast. 
</p>

<h2>Roadways</h2>

<p class="roadways">

Goa's public transport largely consists of privately 
operated buses linking the major towns to rural areas.
 Government-run buses, maintained by the Kadamba Transport 
 Corporation, link major routes (like the Panaji-Margao route)
 and some remote parts of the state. The Corporation owns 15 bus
 stands, 4 depots and one Central workshop at Porvorim and 
 a Head Office at Porvorim. In large towns such as 
 Panajiand Margao, intra-city buses operate. 
 However, public transport in Goa is less developed, 
 and residents depend heavily on their own 
transportation, usually motorised two-wheelers and 
small family cars. 

Goa has four National Highways passing through it.
 NH-66 (ex NH-17) runs along India's west coast and 
 links Goa to Mumbai in the north and Mangalore to
 the south. NH-4A running across the state connects
 the capital Panaji to Belgaum in east, linking Goa 
 to cities in the Deccan. The NH-366 (ex NH-17A) 
 connects NH-66 to Mormugao Port from Cortalim. 
 The new NH-566 (ex NH-17B) is a four-lane highway connecting
 Mormugao Port to NH-66 at Verna via Dabolim Airport, 
 primarily built to ease pressure on the NH-366 for 
 traffic to Dabolim Airport and Vasco da Gama. 
 NH-768 (ex NH-4A) links Panaji and Ponda to Belgaum 
 and NH-4. Goa has a total of 224 km (139 mi) of
 national highways, 232 km (144 mi) of state highway
 and 815 kilometres (506 miles) of district highway.
 National Highways in Goa are among the narrowest in 
 the country and will remain so for the foreseeable 
 future, as the state government has received an
 exemption that allows narrow national highways. 
 In Kerala, highways are 45 metres (148 feet) wide.
 In other states National Highways are grade separated 
 highways 60 metres (200 feet) wide with a minimum of
 four lanes, as well as 6 or 8 lane access-controlled 
 expressways.
Hired forms of transport include unmetered taxis and, 
in urban areas, auto rickshaws. Another form of transportation 
in Goa is the motorcycle taxi, operated by drivers who are locally 
called "pilots". These vehicles transport a single pillion rider,
 at fares that are usually negotiated. Other than
 buses, "pilots" tend to be the cheapest mode of transport.
 River crossings in Goa are serviced by flat-bottomed ferry 
 boats, operated by the river navigation department. 

</p>

<h2>Seaways</h2>

<p class="seaways">

The Mormugao Port Trust near the city of
 Vasco handles mineral ore, petroleum, coal, 
 and international containers. Much of the 
 shipments consist of minerals and ores from 
 Goa's hinterland. Panaji, which is on the
 banks of the Mandovi, has a minor port, 
 which used to handle passenger steamers between 
 Goa and Mumbai till the late 1980s. There was
 also a short-lived catamaran service linking 
Mumbai and Panaji operated by Damania Shipping in the 1990s.

<button class="accordion">Sports</button>

<div class="panel">


<p class="sports">

Normally other states are fond of cricket but
 association football is the most popular sport in
 Goa and is embedded in Goan culture as a result of
 the Portuguese influence.
 Goa, along with West Bengal and Kerala is the locus 
 of football in India and is home to 
many football clubs in the national I-League.
 The state's football powerhouses include Salgaocar, 
 Dempo, Churchill Brothers, Vasco, Sporting Clube de 
 Goa and FC Goa. The first Unity World Cup was held in 
 Goa in 2014. The state's main football stadium,
 Fatorda Stadium, is located at Margao and also 
 hosts cricket matches. The state hosted few
 matches of the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Fatorda Stadium. 
A number of Goans have represented India in football 
and six of them, namely Samir Naik, Climax Lawrence, 
Brahmanand Sankhwalkar, Bruno Coutinho, Mauricio Afonso
 and Roberto Fernandes have all captained the national 
 team. Goa has its own state football team and league, 
 the Goa Professional League. It is probably the only 
 state in India where cricket is not considered the
 most important of all sports. Goan's are avid football 
 
 fans, particularly of the football teams from Portugal 
 (Benfica, Sporting), and Brazil especially during major
 football events such as the 'European Cup' and the 
 'World Cup' championships. The Portuguese footballer 
 'Ronaldo' and Brazilian 'Neymar', are revered superstar
 football players in Goa. 
Goa also has its own cricket team. Dilip Sardesai 
remains the only Goan to date to play international
 cricket for India.
The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) has won
 the right to host the Asian Beach Games in Goa
 in 2020. India (Goa) ia a member of the 
 'Lusophony Olympic Games' which are hosted
 every four years in one of the Portuguese

 CPLP member countries, with 733 athletes 
 from 11 countries. Most of the countries 
 competing are countries that are members 
 of the CPLP (Community of Portuguese Language Countries), 
 but some are countries with significant Portuguese communities, 
 or have a history with Portugal. This event is similar in 
 concept to the Commonwealth Games 
 (for members of the Commonwealth of Nations) 
 and the Jeux de la Francophonie (for the Francophone community).
