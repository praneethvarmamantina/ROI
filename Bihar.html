 <h2>Ajay river</h2>
 <p class="ajay">
 Ajay is a river which flows through the Indian states of 
 Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.
 
 The Ajay River originates on a small hill about 300 metres (980 ft) 
 high, 
 southwest of Deoghar in Jharkhand. It then flows through Jharkhand
 and enters West Bengal at Simjuri, near Chittaranjan. It first forms 
 the border between Bardhaman District and Jharkhand and then between 
 Bardhaman District and Birbhum District, and finally it enters Katwa 
 subdivision of Bardhaman district at Nareng village in Ketugram police 
 station. It then joins the Bhagirathi River at Katwa Town.
 Total length of the Ajay is 288 kilometres (179 mi), out of 
 which 152 kilometres (94 mi) are in West Bengal.
The catchment area of Ajay River is 6,000 square kilometres 
(2,300 sq mi).
</p>
 <h2>Bagmati River</h2>
 <p class="bagmati">
 The Bagmati River runs through the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal and separates
 Kathmandu from Patan. It is considered holy by both Hindus 
 and Buddhists. 
 A number of Hindu temples are located on its banks. 
 The importance of Bagmati also lies in the fact that 
 Hindus are cremated on the banks of this holy river, 
 and Kirants are buried in the hills by its side. 
 According to the Nepalese Hindu tradition, 
 the dead body must be dipped three times into the 
 Bagmati River before cremation, so that the reincarnation 
 cycle may be ended. The chief mourner (usually the first son) 
 who lights the funeral pyre must take a holy river-water bath 
 immediately after cremation. 
 Many relatives who join the funeral procession also take a bath in 
 the Bagmati River or sprinkle the holy water on their bodies at the
 end of cremation. 
 The Bagmati River purifies the people spiritually. 
 </p>
 
 <h2>Burhi Gandak River</h2>
 <p class="burhi">
 The Burhi Gandak River is a tributary of the Ganges. It is known as 
 Sikrahana in its upper reaches. The Burhi (“Old”) Gandak flows 
 parallel to and east of the Gandak River in an old channel. 

The Burhi Gandak originates from Chautarwa Chaur near Bisambharpur 
in the district of West Champaran in Bihar. It initially flows
 through the East Champaran district. After flowing for a distance 
 of about 56 kilometres (35 mi), the river takes a southerly turn 
 where two rivers - the Dubhara and the Tour, join it. Thereafter, 
 the river flows in a south-easterly direction through the Muzaffarpur 
 district for about 32 kilometres (20 mi). In this portion, the 
 river spills over its banks and a number of spill channels take 
 off and rejoin it later.
The Burhi Gandak runs a zig-zag course through the districts of 
Samastipur and Begusarai before covering a short distance in 
Khagaria district, running by the side of the town of Khagaria, 
and flows into the Ganges. It forms the western boundary of the 
Khagaria town and a protection embankment built along the eastern 
side of this river, protects Khagaria town from the floods of Burhi 
Gandak. 
The total length of the river is 320 kilometres (200 mi). 
The drainage area of the river is 10,150 square kilometres 
(3,920 sq mi)
 
 
 </p>
 
 <h2>Durgavati River</h2>
 <p class="durgavati">
 The Durgavati River (also called Durgaoti or Durgauti and 
 spelt as Durgawati) which flows through Kaimur district in 
 the Indian state of Bihar, is a tributary of the Karmanasa. 
 The source of the Durgavati is about 11 kilometres (7 mi) 
 east of that of the Karmanasa. In its upper reaches it is a 
 rocky channel 6 to 9 metres (20 to 30 ft) wide. It runs nearly 
 north for about 14 kilometres (9 mi) when it plunges down the 
 rocky boundary of the table land in to the head of deep glen 
 named Kadhar Kho. There it is joined by three other torrents 
 that like itself rise on the table land of the Turkan Kharawars 
 and fall down the rocks at the head of the same glen. 
 These three torrents are the Lohara, Hatiyadub and Kothas. 
 The Durgavati joins the Karmanasa as a right bank tributary.
 
 </p>
 
 <h2>Gandaki River</h2>
 <p class="Gandaki">
 
 The Gandaki River (also known as the Narayani and the Gandak) 
 is one of the major rivers of Nepal and a left bank tributary 
 of the Ganges in India. In Nepal the river is notable for its 
 deep gorge through the Himalayas. It has a total catchment area 
 of 46,300 square kilometers (17,900 sq mi), most of it in Nepal. 
 The basin also contains three of the world's 14 mountains over
 8,000 metres (26,000 ft), Dhaulagiri, Manaslu and Annapurna I. 
 Dhaulagiri is the highest point of the Gandaki basin. It lies
 between the similar Kosi system to the east and the Karnali 
 (Ghaghara) system to the west. 
 
</p>
 
 <h2>Ganges</h2>
 
<p class="ganges"> 
 
 Ganga is a trans-boundary river of the Indian subcontinent which flows 
 through the nations of India and Bangladesh. The 2,525 km (1,569 mi) 
 river rises in the western Himalayas in the Indian state of 
 Uttarakhand, and flows south and east through the Gangetic Plain 
 of North India. After entering West Bengal, it divides into two 
 rivers: the Hooghly and the Padma River. The Hooghly, or Adi Ganga, 
 flows through several districts of West Bengal and into the 
 Bay of Bengal near Sagar Island. The other, the Padma, also 
 flows into and through Bangladesh, and joins the Meghna river 
 which ultimately empties into the Bay of Bengal. 
 
 
 
 The Ganges is highly polluted. Pollution threatens not only humans, 
 but also more than 140 fish species, 90 amphibian species and the 
 endangered Ganges river dolphin. The Ganges is a major source of 
 global ocean plastic pollution. The levels of fecal coliform 
 bacteria from human waste in the waters of the river near Varanasi 
 are more than 100 times the Indian government's official limit.
 The Ganga Action Plan, an environmental initiative to clean up 
 the river, has been a major failure thus far,
 due to rampant corruption, lack of will on behalf of the 
 government and its bureaucracy, lack of technical expertise,
 poor environmental planning,
 and lack of support from religious authorities.
 
 
 </p>
 
 <h2>Kamala River</h2>
 
 <p class="kamala">
 
 The Kamala River originates from Nepal and flows through Indian state of 
 Bihar. The Kamala originates from Churia Range near Maithan which 
 is near Sindhuliagarhi in Sindhuli District of Nepal at an elevation 
 of 1,200 metres (3,900 ft). It flows in a southerly direction 
 crossing Kamala Khoj area and after passing through a gorge above
 Chauphat it flows into the terai area of Nepal at Chisapani.
 The Kamala forms the border between Siraha and Dhanusa districts 
 in the terai. During the monsoon the river swells up and thus 
 causes devastating river bank erosion.
 Tao River and Baijnath Khola River merges with Kamala at Maini
 
 </p>
 
 
 <h2>Kankai River</h2>
 
 <p class="kankai">
 The Kankai River (also referred to as Mai Khola) is a trans-boundary river flowing through Ilam and Jhapa in north to 
  south direction of Nepal. Holy river of millions of Hindu Devotees 
  living throughout Nepal. Passes through the hills of Ilam and plains 
  of Jhapa District. Kotihom river Bank is the centre for Death rituals
  of millions of Hindus living in Jhapa and Ilam. Kankai Irrigation
  Project launched by Nepal government irrigates the southern Jhapa 
  like Shivganj, Pachgachi, Mahavara etc. 
Kanki Mai or Mai khola has the several points of tourism like Domukha,
 Dhanuskoti, Chuli, Chepti and Maipokhari. The river overfloods during
 the monsoon and has possibility to overflow through the thousands of
 hector of fertile plains of Jhapa. It is really beautiful to view the 
 local fisherman fishing in the river and the children taking bath in 
 heat of sun. Kotihom Surunga Municipality holds annual Mai Mela Fair
 where Millions of people from Jhapa, Morang, Ilam and various parts 
 of India come to enjoy and perform the religious activity on the Day
 of Magh 1st. Kankai Aryaghat for death rituals in Kotihom bank of the 
 river built recently by 
 the public investment is used for death rituals each day by 
the people. 
 
 </p>
 
 
 <h2>Karmanasa River</h2>
 <p class="karmanasa">

 Kaimur district of
 Bihar and flows through the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. 
 Along the boundary between Uttar Pradesh and Bihar it has the 
 districts of Sonbhadra, Chandauli, Varanasi and Ghazipur on its
 left (UP side); and the districts of Kaimur and Buxar on its right 
 (Bihar side).
 
 </p>
 
 
 <h2>Kaunhara ghat</h2>
 
 <p class="kaunhara">
 
 Kaunhara ghat is a river bank in Hajipur in the Indian state of Bihar. 
 Kaunhara ghat is one of the main ghats of the Ganga-Gandak rivers. 
 where worship and cremation have been performed side-by-side for
 centuries. Its name stems from a legend, according to which, the 
 fight of Gaja (elephant)–Graah (crocodile), is the reason behind 
 people asking - kaun haara. Lord Vishnu had to interfere to save
 his devotee Gajaraj from drowning. Both Gaja and Grah were g
 andharavas. Due to a curse they became Gaja and Graah. 
 Lord Visnu killed Graah to give him instant salvation, 
 and saved Gajaraj. The fight is an emblem for the city, 
 and is prominently depicted on the Hajipur railway station's 
 dome, entry point of Sonepur fair and other notable 
 places. 
 
 
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 <h2>Kiul River</h2>
 
 <p class="kiul">
 
 The Kiul River is a tributary of Ganges. It originates in Giridih of Jharkhand 
 and flows through Lakhisarai, Sheikhpura and Jamui districts of 
 the Indian state of Bihar and joins Harohar river in 
 the Diara region. 
 
 </p>
 
 
 
 
 <h2>Koshi River</h2>
 <p class="koshi">
 The Koshi or Kosi River drains the northern slopes of the 
 Himalayas in Tibet and the southern slopes in Nepal. 
 From a major confluence of tributaries north of the Chatra 
 Gorge onwards, the Koshi River is also known as Saptakoshi 
 for its seven upper tributaries. 
 These include the Tamor River originating 
 from the Kanchenjunga area in the east and 
 Arun River and Sun Koshi from Tibet. The Sun Koshi's 
 tributaries from east to west are Dudh Koshi, Bhote Koshi, 
 Tamakoshi River, Likhu Khola and Indravati. The Saptakoshi crosses 
 into northern Bihar where it branches into distributaries before 
 joining the Ganges near Kursela in Katihar district.
The Koshi is 720 km (450 mi) long and drains an area of about 
74,500 square km (28,800 sq mi) in Tibet, Nepal and Bihar.
 In the past, several authors proposed that the river has shifted 
 its course for more than 133 km (83 mi) from east to west during 
 the last 200 years. But a review of 28 historical maps dating 1760 
 to 1960 revealed a slight eastward shift for a long duration, and 
 that the shifting was random and oscillating in nature.
The river basin is surrounded by ridges which separate it from 
the Yarlung Tsangpo River in the north, the Gandaki in the west
 and the Mahananda in the east. The river is joined by major
 tributaries in the Mahabharat Range approximately 48 km (30 mi)
 north of the Indo-Nepal border. Below the Siwaliks, the river
 has built up a megafan some 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) in extent, 
 breaking into more than 12 distinct channels, all with shifting 
 courses due to flooding.
 Kamalā, Bāgmati (Kareh) and Budhi Gandak are major tributaries of
 Koshi in India, besides minor tributaries such as Bhutahi Balān. 
Its unstable nature has been attributed to the heavy silt it carries 
during the monsoon season and flooding in India has extreme effects.
 Fishing is an important enterprise on the river but fishing 
 resources are being depleted and youth are leaving for other 
 areas of work.

 </p>
 
 
 <h2>Lakhandei River</h2>
 
 <p class="lakhandei">
 
 The Lakhandei River is a river in southern Nepal and in the state 
 of Bihar in India. It is a main tributary of the Bagmati River. 
In Nepal, the river basin lies in the Sarlahi District, 
and the river originates in the Sivalik Hills.
 The river enters India in the Sitamarhi district of Bihar, 
 and flows through the town of Sitamarhi. It then enters the 
 Muzaffarpur district, and joins the Bagmati at Katra 
(within the Muzaffarpur district).
 
 </p>
 
 <h2>Lilajan River</h2>
 
 <p class="lilajan">
 
 The Lilajan River is a river that flows through the Chatra and Gaya districts 
 in the Indian states of Jharkhand and Bihar. It is also referred 
 to as the Nilanjan, 
 Niranjan or Falgu River.

 
 The Lilajan begins its journey north of Simaria in Chatra district 
 on the Hazaribagh plateau, the western portion of which constitutes 
 a broad watershed between the Damodar drainage on the south and the
 Lilājan and Mohana rivers on the north. It flows through a deep and 
 rocky channel until it reaches the neighbourhood of Jori. There the 
 hills begin to recede and the stream flows sluggishly over a wide
 sandy bed. From this point to the Gaya border beyond Hunterganj 
 the river becomes sandy. It is dry in summer but disastrous during 
 the rains. About 10 kilometres (6 mi) south of Gaya it unites with
 the Mohana River to form the 
 Falgu River.
 
 </p>
 
 <h2>Mahananda River</h2>
 
 <p class="mahananda">
 The Mahananda River is a trans-boundary river that flows through the
 Indian states of 
 West Bengal and Bihar, 
 and Bangladesh. 
 
 The Mahananda originates in the Himalayas: Paglajhora Falls on 
 Mahaldiram Hill near Chimli, east of Kurseong in Darjeeling district
 at an elevation of 2,100 metres (6,900 ft). It flows through 
 Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary and descends to the plains near 
 Siliguri. It touches Jalpaiguri district. 
It enters Bangladesh near Tentulia in Panchagarh District, 
flows for 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) after Tentulia and returns to India.
 After flowing through Uttar Dinajpur district in West Bengal and 
 Kishanganj and Katihar districts in Bihar, it enters Malda district 
 in West Bengal. The Mahananda divides the district into two 
 regions in the eastern region, consisting mainly of old alluvial and 
 relatively infertile soil is commonly known as Barind (Borendrovomee), 
 and the western region, which is further subdivided by 
 the river Kalindri into two areas, the northern area is known
 as "Tal". It is low-lying and vulnerable to inundation during 
 rainy season; the southern area consists of very fertile land 
 and is thickly populated, being commonly known as "Diara". 
It joins the Ganges at Godagiri in Nawabganj district in Bangladesh.
 
 
</p>

<h2>Mechi River</h2>

<p class="mechi">
The Mechi River is a trans-boundary river flowing through 
Nepal and India. It is a tributary of 
the Mahananda River. 
 
 The Mechi originates in the Mahabharat Range in Nepal. It flows 
 through Nepal, forms the boundary between India and Nepal and then
 flows through the Indian state 
 of Bihar to join the Mahananda in Kishanganj district.
The Mechi-Mahananda interfluve is a transitional area between 
the hills and the plains and exhibits a wide range of topographical 
variations. The rivers originating in the hills attain a braiding 
character and have well developed alluvial fans.
The Mahananda river system of which Mechi is a part has a 
catchment area of 8,088 square kilometres (3,123 sq mi) in Nepal 
and 11,520 square kilometres (4,450 sq mi) in India.

<h2>Mohana River</h2>

<p class="mohana">

The Mohana River (also called Mohani River/Mohane River) 
flows through the Hazaribagh, Chatra and Gaya districts in the

Jharkhand and Bihar. 


The Mohana originates on Korambe Pahar on the Hazaribagh 
plateau near Bendi village, 19.3 kilometres (12.0 mi) from 
Hazaribagh It drains the upper part of the plateau.
 The western portion of the Hazaribagh plateau constitutes a 
 broad watershed between the Damodar drainage on the south and
 the Lilajan (also called Niranjana) and Mohana rivers on the north.
The Mohana then runs north past Itkhori, descends into the Gaya Plains, 
and crosses the Grand Trunk Road / NH 2 at the foot of the Danua pass. 
Near Itkhori it intersects the Chatra-Chauparan Road with its wide
 and sandy channel. 3.2 kilometres (2.0 mi) below Bodh Gaya it 
 unites with the Lilajan (Niranjana) to form the Falgu.
 When it goes past the Barabar Hills, it again takes the
 name of Mohana, 
and divides into two branches.







</p>
 
<h2>Phalgu</h2>

<p class="phalgu">

The Phalgu, a river that flows past Gaya, India in the Indian state
 of Bihar, 
is a sacred river for Hindus 
and Buddhists.

The Phalgu is formed by the confluence, some 3 kilometres (2 mi) 
below Bodh Gaya, of the Lilajan (also called Niranjan or Nilanjan) 
and the Mohana, two large hill streams each of which is over
 270 metres (300 yd) wide. The Phalgu is also mentioned as Niranjan.
 The united stream flows on to the north past the town of Gaya, 
 where it attains a breadth of over 820 metres (900 yd). The Phalgu 
 here passes by a high rocky bank, on the steep sides of which are
 many paved stairs leading down to the river bed, while high above
 are the Vishnupad Mandir, with many minor shrines around it. It
 then runs in a north-easterly direction for about 27 kilometres 
 (17 mi), and opposite the Barabar hills it again takes the name 
 of Mohana, and divides into two branches which eventually flow into
 a branch of the Punpun. 
The Phalgu like its confluent streams, Lilajan and Mohana, 
is subject to high floods during the monsoons but in other seasons 
of the year it dwindles to a stream wandering through a wide expanse
 of sand.
