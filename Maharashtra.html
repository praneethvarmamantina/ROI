<p class="about">

Maharashtra
is a state in the western peninsular region of India 
occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan plateau. It is the second-most 
populous state and third-largest state by area in India. 
Spread over 307,713 square km (118,809 sq mi), it is bordered
 by the Arabian Sea to the west, the Indian states of 
 Karnataka and Goa to the south, Telangana and 
 Chhattisgarh to the east, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh to the 
 north, and the Indian union territory of Dadra and 
 Nagar Haveli to the north west. It is also the world's second-most
 populous subnational entity. It was formed by merging the western and south-western 
 parts of the Bombay State, Berar and Vidarbha, and the north-western 
 parts of the Hyderabad State and splitting Saurashtra (in present-day Gujarat) 
 by the States Reorganisation Act. It has over 112 million 
 inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai, has a population around 18 
 million making it the most populous urban area in India. Nagpur 
 hosts the winter session of the state legislature. Pune is known as the 
 'Oxford of the East' due to the presence of several well-known educational 
 institutions. Nashik is known as the 'Wine Capital of India' as 
 it has the largest number of wineries and vineyards in the country.

<button class="accordion">Rivers</button>

<div class="panel">

<p class="rivers">

Maharashtra presents an interesting range of landforms. The Narmada River, flowing into the Arabian Sea through a rift valley, marks a part of the northern boundary of the State. The other rift valley, of the Tapti River, also flowing into the Arabian Sea, marks the other part of the northern boundary. These two river valleys are separated by a horst known as the Satpura Range. 
<br/>
<br/>
South of the Tapti valley, stretches the Konkan coastland along the Arabian Sea flanked in the east by an escarpment known as the Sahyadri Mountain or the Western Ghats. The foothills of the Sahyadri Mountains reach within 6.4-km of the Arabian Sea in the Konkan. The Konkan coastland is narrow, interspersed with hilly spurs from the Sahyadri mountains and is drained by many small swift west-flowing rivers - of these, the Ulhas in the north is the biggest. 
<br/>
<br/>
The Sahyadri Mountains run like a wall with a north-south trend, almost continuously for 640-km. But several passes through it provide important road and rail links between the coastlands and the interior. The eastern slopes of the Sahyadris descend gently to the Deccan Plateau sculptured by the east sloping valleys of the Godavari, Bhima, and Krishna rivers. The inter-fluves of these rivers form the Mahadeo, Ajanta, Balaghat, and other hill ranges. 
<br/>
<br/>
These hill ranges and valleys within Maharashtra are formed of trap lava with thickness reaching close to 3,050 m in places. Differential erosion of the lava results in characteristic step-like flanks with tabletop appearance in many hills. In the east, beyond Nagpur, the trap country ends, yielding to landforms made of ancient crystalline rocks. From the Mahadeo hills and the Maikal range further east, many important tributaries of the Godavari River flow towards the southeast, of which the Wardha, Wainganga, and the Penganga are the most important. This region abounds in lakes. Further east, the country is rugged with many hills covered with forests and is relatively inhospitable. 
</p>

<h2>Godavari</h2>

<p class="godavari">

Godavari River rises near Nasik in Maharashtra at an elevation of 
1067m and flows for a length of about 1,465-km
 before out falling into the Bay of Bengal. The principal

 Madhya Pradesh (65,255 square km), Orissa (17,752 square km) and Karnataka (4,405 square km).

The chief tributaries of the Purna on the south bank are the Pendhi, Uma, Katepurna, Nirguna and Man. The Katepurna, the largest of all tributaries, rises within a few kilometres of Washim and flows across the eastern side of Akola tehsil and the northwestern corner of Murtizapur. Major Dams on the Purna River are Yeldari Dam (Hydroelectric Power Station) in Jintur Tehsil of Parbhani district. 
</p>


<h3>Tapi</h3> 

<p class="tapi">
Tapi Basin extends over an area of 65,145 square km, which is nearly 2.0% of total geographical area of the country. The basin lies in the states of Maharashtra (51,504 square km), Madhya Pradesh (9,804 square km) and Gujarat (3,837 square km). 
<br/>
<br/>
Tapi River rises near Multai in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh at an elevation of about 752 m and flows for about 724 km before outfalling into the Arabian Sea through the Gulf of Cambay. Its principal tributaries are the Purna, the Girna, the Panjhra, the Vaghur, the Bori and the Aner. 
<br/>
<br/>
The basin consists plain areas, which are broad and fertile, suitable for cultivation. The principal soils found in the basin are black soils, alluvial clays with a layer of black soil above. 
<br/>
<br/>
An average annual surface water potential of 18 km3 has been assessed in this basin. Out of this 14.5 km3 is utilisable water. Cultivable area in the basin is about 4.3 Million ha, which is 2.2% of the total cultivable area of the country. 
<br/>
<br/>
Present use of surface water in the basin is 4.5 km3. Live storage capacity in the basin has increased significantly since independence. From just about 0.05 km3 in first-plan period, the total live storage capacity of the completed projects has increased to 8.5 km3. In addition, a storage quantity of over 1.0 km3 would be created on completion of projects under construction. An additional storage to the tune of over 2.0 km3 would become available on execution of projects under consideration. The hydropower potential of the basin is 119.7 MW at 60% load factor.

<p class="transport">
The state has a large, multi-modal transportation system 
with the largest road network in India. In 2011, the total 
length of surface road in Maharashtra was 267,452 km;
 national highways comprised 4,176 km and state highways 3,700 km.
 The Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC) provides 
 economical and reliable passenger road transport service in the public sector.
 These buses, popularly called ST (State Transport), are the 
 preferred mode of transport for much of the populace. 
 Hired forms of transport include metered taxis and auto rickshaws, 
 which often ply specific routes in cities. Other district 
 roads and village roads provide villages accessibility to 
 meet their social needs as well as the means to transport agricultural 
 produce from villages to nearby markets. Major district roads provide a 
 secondary function of linking between main roads and rural roads. 
 Almost 98% of villages are connected via the highways and modern roads in 
 Maharashtra. Average speed on state highways varies between 50-60 km/h (31-37 mi/h) 
 due to heavy presence of vehicles; in villages and towns, 
 speeds are as low as 25-30 km/h (15-18 mi/h). 
<br/>
<br/>
The first passenger train in India ran from Mumbai to Thane on 16 April 1853.
 Rail transportation consists of the Central Railway and the Western Railway zones 
 of the Indian Railways that are headquartered in Mumbai, 
 at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) and Churchgate respectively.
 The Mumbai Rajdhani Express, the fastest rajdhani train, connects the Indian capital of New Delhi to Mumbai.
 Thane and CST are the busiest railway stations in India,
 the latter serving as a terminal for both long-distance 
 trains and commuter trains of the Mumbai Suburban Railway. 
 Nanded division of South central railway comprises Marathwada region. 
<br/>
<br/>
The two principal sea ports, Mumbai Port and Jawaharlal Nehru 
Port, which is also in the Mumbai region, are under the control 
and supervision of the government of India. There are around 48 minor ports in
 Maharashtra. Most of these handle passenger traffic and have a 
 limited capacity. None of the major rivers in Maharashtra are navigable 
 and so river transport does not exist in the state. 
Almost all the major cities of Maharashtra have airports. 
CSIA (formerly Bombay International Airport) and Juhu Airport are the two airports in
 Mumbai. The two other international airports are Pune International Airport 
 and Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport (Nagpur). 
 While Aurangabad Airport is domestic airport operated by Airports 
 Authority of India. Flights are operated by both private 
 and government airline companies.Nashik Airport is also a major airport.
