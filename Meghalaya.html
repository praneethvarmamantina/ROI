<h2>Cherrapunji</h2>

<p class="cherrapunji">

Cherrapunji is a subdivisional town in the East Khasi Hills district in the Indian state of Meghalaya. It is credited as being the wettest place on Earth, but nearby Mawsynram currently holds that record. Cherrapunji still holds the all-time record for the most rainfall in a calendar month and in a year. It received 9,300 mm (366 in) in July 1861 and 26,461 mm (1,041.75 in) between 1 August 1860 and 31 July 1861. Cherrapunji is the traditional capital of the Nongkhlaw hima (Khasi tribal chieftainship constituting a petty state) known as Sohra or Churra. Cherrapunji is also famous for its living bridges. Over hundreds of years the people in Cherrapunji have developed techniques for growing roots of trees into large bridges. The process takes 10-15 years and the bridges typically last hundreds of years, the oldest ones in use being over 500 years old. Cherrapunji receives rains from the Bay of Bengal arm of the Indian summer monsoon. The monsoon clouds fly unhindered over the plains of Bangladesh for about 400 km. Thereafter, they hit the Khasi Hills which rise abruptly from the plains to a height of about 1,370 m above mean sea level within 2 to 5 km. The geography of the hills with many deep valleys channels encompassing the low-flying (150-300 m) moisture-laden clouds from a wide area converges over Cherrapunji. The winds push the rain clouds through these gorges and up the steep slopes. The rapid ascent of the clouds into the upper atmosphere hastens the cooling and helps vapours to condense. Most of Cherrapunji's rain is the result of air being lifted as a large body of water vapour. The extreme amount of rainfall at Cherrapunji is perhaps the best-known feature of orographic rain in northeast India. Occasionally, cloudbursts can occur in one part of Cherrapunji while other areas may be totally or relatively dry, reflecting the high spatial variability of the rainfall. Atmospheric humidity is extremely high during the peak monsoon period. The major part of the rainfall at Cherrapunji can be attributed to the orographic features. When the clouds are blown over the hills from the south, they are funneled through the valley. The clouds strike Cherrapunjee perpendicularly and the low flying clouds are pushed up the steep slopes. It is not surprising to find that the heaviest rainfalls occur when the winds blow directly on the Khasi Hills. A notable feature of monsoon rain at Cherrapunji is that most of it falls in the morning. This could be partly due to two air masses coming together. During the monsoon months, the prevailing winds along the Brahmaputra valley generally blow from the east or the northeast, but the winds over Meghalaya are from the south. These two winds systems usually come together in the vicinity of the Khasi Hills. Apparently the winds that are trapped in the valley at night begin their upward ascent only after they are warmed during the day. This partially explains the frequency of morning rainfall. Apart from orographic features, atmospheric convection plays an important role during the monsoon and the period just preceding it.

<h2>Shillong</h2>

Shillong has steadily grown in size since it was made the civil station of the Khasi and Jaintia Hills in 1864 by the British. In 1874, on the formation of Assam as the Chief Commissioner's Province, it was chosen as the headquarters of the new administration because of its convenient location between the Brahmaputra and Surma valleys and more so because the climate of Shillong was much cooler than tropical India. Shillong remained the capital of undivided Assam until the creation of the new state of Meghalaya on 21 January 1972, when Shillong became the capital of Meghalaya, and Assam moved its capital to Dispur in Guwahati.

<h2>Mawsynram</h2>

<p class="mawsynram">
Mawsynram is a village in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya state in north-eastern India, 65 kilometres from Shillong. It is reportedly the wettest place on Earth, with an average annual rainfall of 11,872 millimetres (467.4 in), but that claim is disputed by Lloró, Colombia, which reported an average yearly rainfall of 12,717 millimetres (500.7 in) between 1952 and 1989 and López de Micay, also in Colombia, which reported 12,892 mm (507.6 in) per year between 1960 and 2012. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Mawsynram received 26,000 millimetres (1,000 in) of rainfall in 1985. Mawsynram is located at 25° 18' N, 91° 35' E, at an altitude of about 1,400 metres (4,600 ft), 16 km west of Cherrapunji, in the Khasi Hills in the state of Meghalaya (India) . The name of the village contains Maw, a Khasi word meaning stone, and thus might refer to certain megaliths in the surrounding area. Khasi Hills are rich with such megaliths. Climate and rainfall: Under the Köppen climate classification, Mawsynram features a subtropical highland climate with an extraordinarily showery and long monsoonal season and a short dry season. Based on the data of a recent few decades, it appears to be the wettest place in the world, or the place with the highest average annual rainfall. Mawsynram receives nearly 10,000 millimeters of rain in an average year, and the vast majority of rain it falls during the monsoon months. Primarily due to the high altitude, it seldom gets truly hot in Mawsynram. Average monthly temperatures range from around 11°C in January to just above 20°C in August. The village also experiences a brief but noticeably drier season from December until February, when monthly precipitation on average does not exceed 30 millimetres (1.2 in). The little precipitation during the village’s “low sun” season is something that is shared by many areas with this type of climate. Three reasons can be cited for high rainfall at Mawsynram: 1)The warm moist winds of the northward-moving air from the Bay of Bengal during the monsoon, which cover an extensive area but are forced to converge into the narrower zone over the Khasi Hills, thus concentrating their moisture. 2)The alignment of the Khasi Hills (east to west) places them directly in the path of the airflow from the Bay of Bengal, producing a significant uplift (plus cooling, further condensation and thus more rain). 3)Finally, uplift over the Khasi Hills is virtually continuous in the monsoon period because the lifted air is constantly being pulled up by vigorous winds in the upper atmosphere, hence the rainfall is more or less continuous. Natural landmarks: Located in Mawsynram, is a cave named Mawjymbuin, known for its stalagmites. Inside this cave is a pair of notable speleothems - breast-shaped stalactite over a massive stalagmite. The area is known for its many caves, commercialised and non-commercialised, which contain remnants of a past that tells us of the history of the plateau that was once under water.

The partition of the country in 1947 created severe infrastructural constraints for 
 the Northeastern region, with merely 2% of the perimeter of
 the region adjoining the rest of the country. A narrow strip 
 of land often called the Siliguri Corridor or the Chicken's Neck,
 connects the region with the state of West Bengal. Meghalaya is a 
 landlocked state with a large number of small settlements in 
 remote areas. The road is the only means of transport. While the
 capital Shillong is relatively well connected, road connectivity
 in most other parts is relatively poor. A significant portion of
 the roads in the state is still unpaved. Most of the arrivals into
 the Meghalaya take place through Guwahati in neighbouring Assam,
 which is nearly 103 km away. Assam has a major railhead as well
 as an airport with regular train and air services to the rest of the country. 
When Meghalaya was carved out of Assam as an autonomous state in 1972,
 it inherited a total road length of 2786.68 km including 174 km of
 National Highways with road density of 12.42 km per 100 square 
 kilometre. By 2004, total road length has reached up to 9,350
 km out of which 5,857 km were surfaced. The road density had 
 increased to 41.69 km per 100 square kilometre by March 2011.
 However, Meghalaya is still far below the national average of
 75 km per 100 square km. In order to provide 
 better services to the people of the state, the Meghalaya
 Public Works Department is taking steps for 
 improvement and up-gradation of the existing 
 roads and bridges in phased manner.
