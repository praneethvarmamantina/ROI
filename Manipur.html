<p class="mayang">

<h2>Moreh</h2>

<p class="moreh">


Moreh is a town located on the India-Myanmar border in the Tengnoupal district of the Indian state of Manipur. The town is inhabited by Kuki people and a sizeable number of Tamil, Nepali, Meitei, Punjabi, Telugu, Bihari, Marwari and Pangals. Previously, Moreh was in the Kabow Valley Zone. The town is an important and rapidly developing trade point in India on the border with Myanmar, with the town of Tamu being close to the border. Moreh is already a huge commercial hub, and economists suggest that it could become another bustling city in the next couple of decades. Moreh is already seen as the commercial capital of Manipur and India's Gateway to South-East Asia. In 2007, according to The Economist, Moreh was to gain a branch railway via Imphal. The Indo-Myanmar Friendship Bridge in Moreh connects India to Kalewa in Myanmar's Sagaing Division. The highway on the Myanmar side is intended to run up to Mandalay but it is in bad shape. Indian planners hope the rail link to Moreh will eventually be connected to the Myanmar railway system, allowing onward connectivity to Thailand and China. As Moreh shares a border with Myanmar. it is a transit point for trafficking illicit drugs to the international market. Road to Thailand: India’s foreign minister met with Myanmar’s construction minister in Delhi on the 22nd Feb 2012, and spoke about opening a highway between Moreh, in India, and the Myanmar-Thai border near Mae Sot. Indian Prime minister Manmohan Singh and U Thein Sein have set a deadline of 2016 to provide trilateral road connectivity, that would make it possible to drive from India to Thailand via Myanmar. Trans-Asian Railway: As of 2012, all freight traffic from Asia to Europe goes by sea. The Trans-Asian Railway will enable containers from Singapore, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand and Korea to travel over land by train to Europe. The Southern Corridor of the Trans-Asian Railway is of prime interest to India. It connects Yunnan in China and Thailand with Europe via Turkey and passes through India. There is a general understanding between India and Myanmar that their railways will be interconnected via a 346-km line section that will extend from Kalay in Myanmar to Jiribam in India via the border point at Tamu/Moreh, India. The proposed route will enter India through Tamu and Moreh, then enter Bangladesh through Mahisasan and Shahbajpur and again enter India from Bangladesh at Gede. On the western side, the line will enter Pakistan at Attari. There is a 315 kilometres (196 mi) missing link on this route in the India-Myanmar sector; of this, 180 kilometres (110 mi), in India, is between Jiribam in Manipur and Tamu, Burma in Myanmar. The rail link between Jiribam and Tapul/Imphal has been sanctioned by Indian Railways, but that is unlikely to be completed before 2016. In 2011, construction work was in progress in a 97 kilometres (60 mi) stretch between Jiribam and Tupul/Imphal. India's Ministry Railway has also approved the Tapul/Imphal to Moreh, India/Tamu, Burma link.

<h2>Bishnupur</h2>

<p class="bishnupur">

Bishnupur is a town in Bishnupur district in the state of Manipur, India. It derived its name from an ancient Vishnu temple located in the town. Bishunupur is the administrative headquarters of Bishnupur District. It was once the capital of the kingdom of Manipur. In ancient times, Tongjei Maril (literally 'tubehole') through Bishnupur was the sole road linking Manipur with the rest of India. Bishnupur was one of the sites of the World War II where fierce fightings between the Allied Forces and the Japanese Forces took place. The British war hero, Major-General Orde Wingate, the founder of the Chindits force, died in a plane crash near Bishnupur while flying back from Chindit-held bases in Burma. Many descendants of Japanese armed forces who died here during the War visit Bishnupur to pay homage to their departed ancestors. Loukoipat: Loukoipat, a small natural lake sandwiched between two knolls is a picturesque tourist spot in Bishnupur. Here, the beauty of hills converges with the beauty of lake. The panoramic view of the Manipur valley from the higher slopes of Loukoipat tourist lodge is sure to please the viewers' senses. Loukoipat is further being developed with an ecological park. Vishnu Temple: Vishnu Temple at Bishnupur is a 15th-century temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu. King Kyamba of Manipur along with Chaopha Khe Khomba, the king of Pong, conquered Kyang, a Shan kingdom in the Kabow Valley of present Myanmar. Jubilant at the victory, an idol of Lord Vishnu was given by the Pong king to King Kyamba. King Kyamba started worshipping the idol at Lumlangdong which then came to be known as Bishnupur i.e. abode of Vishnu. Subsequently, he built a Vishnu Temple of brick at Bishnupur which has now become a protected historical monument under the Ministry of H.R.D (Archeology), Government of India. It is now standing as a symbol of the remains of ancient times. And the statue got by Kyamba from the Pong king is very important since it gives us the idea of the religious beliefs of those days and the very name that it had given. During the rule of Kyamba the worship of Vishnu began in Manipur again. A little image of Lord Vishnu was presented by th King of Pong when he concluded a treaty with the king of Manipur in 1470 AD. Kyamba built a brick temple at Bishnupur and installed the image there. In this way the worship of Lord Vishnu began in Manipur again. But "in spite of regular worship of Vishnu Kyamba was not initiated to Vaishnavism by a preceptor." The presence of Aribam Brahmins who worshipped Vishnu during Kyamba proves that 'Varna bebhag' or caste discrimination of the Brahmonical order of Indian caste system was there in Manipur at that time and Vaishnavism which discarded 'Barna bebhag' had not yet entered in the Manipur society. That was why the people of that particular area of Manipur washed the spot where Guru Nanak and Mardana sat considering them to be low caste human beings.

Yubi lakpi is a traditional full contact game played in Manipur, India, 
using a coconut, which has some notable similarities to rugby.
 Yubi lakpi literally means "coconut snatching". The coconut is 
 greased to make it slippery. There are rules of the game, as with 
 all Manipur sports. The coconut serves the purpose of a ball 
 and is offered to the king, the chief guest or the judges 
 before the game begins. The aim is to run while carrying the 
 greased coconut and physically cross over the goal line, while the 
 other team tackles and blocks any such attempt as well as tries to 
 grab the coconut and score on its own. In Manipur's long history, Yubi 
 lakpi was the annual official game, attended by the king, over the Hindu 
 festival of Shree Govindajee. It is like the game of rugby, or 
 American football. 
<br/>
<br/>
Oolaobi (Woo-Laobi) is an outdoor game mainly played by females. Meitei 
mythology believes that UmangLai Heloi-Taret (seven deities–seven fairies) 
played this game on the Courtyard of the temple of Umang Lai Lairembi. 
The number of participants is not fixed but are divided into two groups 
(size as per agreement). Players are divided as into Raiders (Attackers) or 
Defenders (Avoiders). Hiyang tannaba, also called Hi Yangba Tanaba,
 is a traditional boat rowing race and festivity of the Panas.
<br/>
<br/>
Captain Robert Stewart and Lieutenant Joseph Sherer
 of the British colonial era first watched locals play a rules-based 
 pulu or sagolkangjei (literally, horse and stick) game in 1859. 
 They adopted its rules, calling the game polo, and playing 
 it on their horses. The game spread among the British in Calcutta and then to England. 
Apart from these games, some outdoor children's games are fading in
 popularity. Some games such as Khutlokpi, Phibul Thomba, and Chaphu 
 Thugaibi remain very popular elsewhere, such as in Cambodia. 
 They are played especially during the Khmer New Year. 
First of its kind in India, National Sports University
 will be constructed in Manipur.
