<p class="cities">
 Cities of Sikkim lie in the lap of the eastern Himalayan mountain ranges forming the hill stations. Herein lies Mount Khanchendzonga (8534 mts), the third highest mountain in the world. The cities are placed in a network of mountain peaks, lush valleys, fast flowing rivers and hills. Cities of Sikkim with all their grandeur provide a perfect place for tourists to experience a warm ambience. 

Cities of Sikkim offer such contrast that within a few hours one can shift from the sub tropical heat of the lower valleys to the cold of the rugged mountain slopes that reach up to the region of everlasting snow. Different festivals celebrated in the cities are the Hindu festivals of Diwali and Dussera and the common Buddhist festivals of Losar, Loosong, Saga Dawa, Lhabab Duechen, Drupka Teshi and Bhumchu. The major cities of Sikkim areGangtok (the capital city), Pelling, Gezing, Mangan, Namchi and Yuksan.

<button class="accordion">Rivers</button>


<div class="panel">

<p class="rivers">

Teesta is the major river system in the State. Teesta river originates as Chhombo Chhu from a glacial lake Khangchung Chho at an elevation of 5,280 m in the northeastern corner of the state. The glacial lake lies at the snout of the Teesta Khangse glacier descending from Pauhunri peak (7,056 m) in north western direction. Teesta Khangse glacier and Chho Lhamo are also considered as the source of Teesta river by many authors. Along its traverse from its origin to the plains, the river receives drainage from a number of tributaries on either side of its course. The tributaries on the eastern flank are shorter in course but larger in number whereas the tributaries on the western flank are much longer with larger drainage areas, consequently contributing much more amount of discharge to the main Teesta river. Furthermore, right-bank tributaries drain heavily glaciated areas with large snow-fields. The left bank tributaries, on the other hand, originate from semi-permanent and much smaller snow-fields as compared to right bank tributaries.

<h2>Airways</h2>

<p class="airways">

Sikkim did not have any operational airport for a long time 
because of its rough terrain. However in October 2018, 
Pakyong Airport, the state's first airport, located at 
a distance of 30 km (19 mi) from Gangtok, became
 operational after a four-year delay.
 It has been constructed by the Airports Authority of 
 India on 200 acres of land. At an altitude of 4,700 feet (1,400 m)
 above sea level, it is one of the five highest airports in India.
 The airport is capable of operating ATR aircraft.
<br/>
<br/> 
Before October 2018, the closest operational airport to Sikkim was 
Bagdogra Airport near Siliguri in northern West Bengal.
 The airport is located about 124 km (77 mi) from Gangtok, and frequent buses connect the two.
 A daily helicopter service run by the Sikkim Helicopter Service connects 
 Gangtok to Bagdogra; the flight is thirty minutes long, operates only once a day, 
 and can carry four people.
 The Gangtok helipad is the only civilian helipad in the state. 



</p>

<h2>Railways</h2>

<p class="railways">

Sikkim lacks significant railway infrastructure.
 The closest major railway stations are Siliguri and New 
 Jalpaiguri in neighbouring West Bengal.
 However, the New Sikkim Railway Project has been launched 
 to connect the town of Rangpo in Sikkim with Sevoke on the West Bengal border. 
 The five-station line is intended to support both economic 
 development and Indian Army operations and was initially 
 planned to be completed by 2015,
 though as of 2013 its construction has met with delays.
 In addition, the Ministry of Railways proposed plans in 2010 for 
 railway lines linking Mirik to Ranipool.




</p>

<h2>Roadways</h2>

<p class="roadways">

National Highway 10 (NH 10; formerly NH 31A) links Siliguri to Gangtok.
 Sikkim National Transport runs bus and truck services. Privately run bus,
 tourist taxi, and jeep services operate throughout Sikkim and also connect 
 it to Siliguri. A branch of the highway from Melli connects western Sikkim.
 Towns in southern and western Sikkim are connected to the hill stations 
 of Kalimpong and Darjeeling in northern West Bengal.
 The state is furthermore connected to Tibet by the 
 mountain pass of Nathu La.
