<button class="accordion">Rivers</button>

<div class="panel">

<p class="rivers">

The State of J&K is considered as a paradise on earth 
with ample water resources such as lakes, rivers, and 
glaciers besides groundwater. The main rivers that flow 
through the State are Jhelum, Chenab, Indus and Tawi and
 are of Himalayan origin. The other great rivers that
 originate from glaciers in the Himalayan region are 
 the Ganges and the Yamuna. Important lakes in the 
 J&K region are Manasabal Lake, Dal Lake, Nageen Lake
 and the Wular Lake. There are 1230 water bodies in the State.



</p>

<h2>Jhelum</h2>

<p class="jhelum">

The river Jhelum is commonly known as 'The Veth'. 
The river flows throughout the length of the valley.
 This river flows as a muddy stream and is a famous
 tourist attraction, especially the nine old brides
 that have been made over it all along in the Srinagar 
 city. The source of this famous river is Verinag spring 
 in district Anantnag. In the Valley of Kashmir this river
 has a length of about 203 kms. After passing through 
 Srinagar it flows into the Wular Lake, which is
 regarded as its delta and then passing through 
 Baramulla and Uri, it flows to Pakistan. Srinagar,
 Anantnag and Baramulla cities are situated on both 
 sides of this river. Most of the electricity generated 
 in Kashmir Valley 
is generated by the Hydel projects constructed on this river.

</p>

<h2>Indus</h2>

<p class="indus">

The Indus river originates
 at the confluence of the Sind river 
 and the Gar River, which is Mansaror 
 Lake in Tibet. This river takes a lengthy 
 and tortuous course and passes through
 the Kashmir region. It is the longest 
 river in the subcontinent. While it is 
 about 3500 kms long, 1500 km of it flows
 through Jammu and Kashmir. The river is 
 excellent for those interested in water rafting.
 The river banks are flanked by steep hills that
 have pine and deodar vegetation. The Indus
 River flows in between the Ladakh range 
 and the Zanskar range. Indus has several 
 tributaries, principal among them are Gilgit
 River, Gumal River and Kabul River.



</p>

<h2>Chenab</h2>

<p class="chenab">


The merging of two Himalayan rivers 
forms the river Chenab. These are the
 Chandra River and the Bhaga River. Thus,
 the river Chenab is popularly known as the 
 Chandrabhaga. This river is also well known
 for its historical importance. This river
 enters J&K near Paddar at Kishtwar. The
 river Wadwan joins it near Akhnoor. It
 enters the plains of Jammu and then enters
 into Pakistan. Rambir and Partap canal takes 
 off from it near Akhnoor as a result of which
 thousands of Kanals of agricultural land in
 Jammu is irrigated. Salal, Dulhasiti, Sawalkot
 and Baghilar Hydel power projects are located on this river.


</p>


<h2>Kishan Ganga</h2>

<p class="kishan">
This river is famous for its ice-cold water and trout
 Fish. Kishan Ganga River is in Drass (Kargil) in inner 
 Himalayas. After passing through the mountain tracks of 
 Gurez, Keran and Karnah it joins the Jhelum at Doemel. 
Kishan Ganga hydro-electric Project is situated on this river.

</p>


<h2>Tawi</h2>

<p class="tawi">
The source of Tawi is the Kailash Kund Spring at Soej hills in Bhaderwah. After flowing through the Chennani and Udhampur, Tawi passes through Jammu and joins the Chenab in Ranbir Singh Pora and then enters Pakistan. Chennani hydro electric power project constructed on River Tawi has a capacity to generate 23 MW of power.

</p>

<h2>Ravi</h2>

<p class="ravi">

Ravi is a Trans boundary river flowing through northwestern India and Northeastern Pakistan. After the partition of India in 1947, the waters of River Ravi alongwith five other rivers of the Indus system (Beas, Sutlej, Chenab, Jhelum and Indus) keep India and Pakistan under the Indus Water Treaty and form the headquarters of Indus Basin. The river drains a total catchment area of 14442 sq kms in India after flowing for a length of 720 kms. A major tributary that joins Ravi is Siawa near Basholi in the State. Ujh River is another major tributary of Ravi and its source is located in the Kailash Mountains at an elevation of 14,100 ft close to Bhaderwah Mountains of the State. After flowing for 100 kms stretch, it joins Ravi at Nainkot in Pakistan. It flows along the Indo-Pak border for about 80 kms, before entering Pakistan and joining the Chenab. The major multipurpose project built on this river is Ranjit Sagar Dam at Thein village. The left bank of Ravi is in Punjab and the right bank is in J&K State.

 the Indian Air Force has handed the airport
 to Airports Authority of India and AAI will 
 expand it for civilian purposes. But those reports

 by Ministry of Defence and Leh Deputy Commissioner.
 They clarified that the IAF would vacate only a small
 part of land for construction of a new terminal.
