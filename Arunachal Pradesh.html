<p>Arunachal Pradesh is one of the 29 states of India and is the northeastern-most state of the country. Arunachal Pradesh borders 
the states of Assam and Nagaland to the south and shares international borders with Bhutan in the west, Myanmar in the east and
 is separated from China in the north by the McMahon Line. Itanagar is the capital of the state.

A major part of the state is claimed by the Republic of China, and the People's Republic of China referring to it as "South Tibet". 
During the 1962 Sino-Indian war, Chinese forces temporarily crossed McMahon line, the border line between the state and China.

Land of the Dawn-Lit Mountains is the sobriquet for the state in Sanskrit;it is also known as the Orchid State of India or the Paradise
 of the Botanists. Geographically, it is the largest of the Seven Sister States of Northeast India.

<button class="accordion">Rivers</button>



<div class="panel">


<p class="Rivers">The Brahmaputra is one of the major rivers of Asia, a trans-boundary river which flows through China, India and Bangladesh.
AIt is also called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra (when referring to the whole river including the stretch within Tibet).The Manas River, which runs through Bhutan,
joins it at Jogighopa, in India. It is the ninth largest river in the world by discharge, and the 15th longest.

With its origin in the Manasarovar Lake region, located on the northern side of the Himalayas in Burang County of Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo River,
it flows across southern Tibet to break through the Himalayas in great gorges (including the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon) and into Arunachal Pradesh (India).
It flows southwest through the Assam Valley as Brahmaputra and south through Bangladesh as the Jamuna (not to be mistaken with Yamuna of India). In the vast Ganges Delta, it merges with the Padma, the popular name of the river Ganges in Bangladesh, and finally the Meghna and from here it is known as Meghna before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.[4]

About 3,848 km (2,391 mi) long, the Brahmaputra is an important river for irrigation and transportation. The average depth of the river is 38 m (124 ft) 
and maximum depth is 120 m (380 ft). The river is prone to catastrophic flooding in the spring when Himalayas snow melts. The average discharge of the river 
is about 19,800 m3/s (700,000 cu ft/s),and floods can reach over 100,000 m3/s (3,500,000 cu ft/s).It is a classic example of a braided river and is 
highly susceptible to channel migration and avulsion.It is also one of the few rivers in the world that exhibit a tidal bore. It is navigable for most 
of its length.

The river drains the Himalaya east of the Indo-Nepal border, south-central portion of the Tibetan plateau above the Ganga basin, south-eastern portion of Tibet,
the Patkai-Bum hills, the northern slopes of the Meghalaya hills, the Assam plains, and the northern portion of Bangladesh. The basin, especially south of Tibet,
is characterized by high levels of rainfall. Kangchenjunga (8,586 m) is the only peak above 8,000 m, hence is the highest point within the Brahmaputra basin.

The Brahmaputra's upper course was long unknown, and its identity with the Yarlung Tsangpo was only established by exploration in 1884–86. This river is often 
called Tsangpo-Brahmaputra river.

The lower reaches are sacred to Hindus. While most rivers on the Indian subcontinent have female names, this river has a rare male name, as it means
"son of Brahma" in Sanskrit (putra means "son").</p>

<h2 class="Rivers">Dibang River</h2>
<p class="Rivers">Dibang River, also known as Sikang in Adi and Talon in Idu, is a tributary river of the Brahmaputra that originated and flows through 
the Mishmi Hills & northeast India from the state of Arunachal Pradesh.
The Dibang originates near Keya pass on the Indo-Chinese border in the Dibang Valley district of Arunachal Pradesh. The drainage basin of the river 
within Arunachal Pradesh covers the districts of Dibang Valley and Lower Dibang Valley.The Mishmi Hills lie in the upper course of the Dibang which 
enters the plains at Bomjir, Dambuk etc . Between Bomjir (Nizamghat) and Sadiya the Dibang has a steep river gradient and exhibits braided channel 
morphology with its width varying from 4 to 9 kilometres (2 to 6 mi). It often changes its course resulting in flooding and destruction of cultivable 
land and forests along its banks.The Dibang, with a total length of 195 kilometres (121 mi),
enters the River Lohit north of the Dibru-Saikhowa sanctuary near the Assamese town of Sadiya.</p>

<h2 class="Rivers">Dihing River</h2>
<p class="Rivers">Dihing or Burhi Dihing is a large tributary, about 380 kilometres (240 mi) long,[1] of the Brahmaputra River in Upper Assam in northeastern 
India.The river originates at 2,375 metres (7,792 ft) above sea level in the Eastern Himalayas (the Patkai Hills)[1] in Arunachal Pradesh and flows through 
Tinsukia (Tinicukeeya) and Dibrugarh Districts in Assam to its confluence with the Brahmaputra at Dihingmukh. Its watershed covers about 6,000 square 
kilometres (2,300 sq mi).
The Dihing has created number of oxbow lakes in the area.

The Disang is a tributary of the Dihing in its southern bank. The Joy-Dihing Rainforest, numerous petroleum fields, wet-paddy fields, bamboo 
orchards and tea gardens provide a unique landscape along its course. Ledo, Margherita, Digboi, Duliajan and Naharkatia (Nahorkotiya) are the 
small towns in its valley. Dihing is the one of the most important contributors to the Brahmaputra River. The plains of the Dihing Valley has a 
rich variety of flora and fauna. The Betel nuts are produced most in the areas of the Dihing Plains.</p>

<h2 class="Rivers">Kameng River</h2>
<p class="Rivers">The Kameng River,now called Kameng in Arunachal Pradesh and Jia Bhoreli in Assam) in the eastern Himalayan mountains, originates in Tawang district from the glacial lake 
below snow-capped Gori Chen mountain 27°48′36″N 92°26′38″E,elevation 6,300 metres (20,669 ft),on the India-Tibet border in South Tibet and flows 
through Bhalukpong circle of West Kameng District, Arunachal Pradesh and Sonitpur District of Assam, India.
It is one of the major tributaries of the Brahmaputra River, joining it at Tezpur, just east of the Kolia Bhomora Setu bridge.

The Kameng River is about 264 kilometres (164 mi) long. Its drainage basin is about 11,843 square kilometres (4,573 sq mi) large.

The Kameng forms the boundary between East Kamemg District and West Kameng Districts and is also the boundary between the Sessa and 
Eaglenest sanctuaries to its west and the Pakke tiger reserve to the east.The Dafla Hills are east and the Aka Hills (home of Aka tribe) 
are west of the Kameng River. The entire stretch of forest along the Bhalukpong–Bomdila highway on the west bank of the river in West Kameng 
has vanished in the last few years though the forest across the river continues to be in a healthy state.</p>


<h2 class="Rivers">Lohit River</h2>
<p class="Rivers">The Lohit River or Zayü River is a river in India and China. It is a tributary to the Brahmaputra River.
The river rises in eastern Tibet, in the Kangri Garpo range. It descends through this mountainous region and surges through Arunachal Pradesh 
in India for 200 kilometres (120 mi) before entering the plains of Assam where it is known as the Lohit River. Tempestuous and turbulent,
and known as the river of blood partly attributable to the lateritic soil, it flows through the Mishmi Hills, to meet the Siang (Brahmaputra) 
at the head of the Brahmaputra valley.

Thickly forested for the most part, alpine vegetation gives way to subtropical forests, and then to some of the densest tropical jungles in 
all of India. Rhododendrons bloom in many hues in the upper reaches, orchids reveal themselves in the lower groves. This is indeed a treasure 
house of medicinal plant and herbs, and the home of Mishmi teeta, the coptis plant, prized the world over for its medicinal properties.</p>
<h2 class="Rivers">Subansiri River</h2>
<p class="Rivers">
Brahmaputra River basin in violet, including the Subansiri River
The Subansiri River is a tributary of the Brahmaputra River in the Indian states of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh, and the Tibet Autonomous Region of China.
The Subansiri is 442 kilometres (275 mi) long, with a drainage basin 32,640 square kilometres (12,600 sq mi) large.The Subansiri is the largest tributary 
of the Brahmaputra. Its maximum observed discharge was 18,799 cubic metres per second (663,900 cu ft/s), and its minimum 131 m3/s (4,600 cu ft/s).
It contributes 7.92% of the Brahmaputra's total flow.

The Subansiri River originates in the Himalayas, in China. It flows east and southeast into India, then south to the Assam Valley, where 
it joins the Brahmaputra River in Lakhimpur district.

The Mishmis hold sway in the hills. In the plains are the Khamptis and the Singphos, fervent Buddhists and migrants from across he Patkai
 hills from Burma. As the Lohit journeys through, Tibetan theology gives way to animist belief, in turn replaced by Theravada Buddhism and
 then by Hindu temples. This region experiences a mix of many cultures near the tripoint between Tibet, Southeast Asia, and South Asia.

The Lohit river comes into India from China and flows near India's eastern most inhabited tip, at a place called Kibithu. The Indian Army 
uses this river for various expeditions and training.</p>

<h2 class="Airports">Airports</h2>

<h2 class="Along">Along Airport<h2>



<p class="Along">Along Airport (IATA: IXV, ICAO: VEAN) also known as Aalo Airport is located at Along in the
 state of Arunachal Pradesh, India.

The Government of Arunachal Pradesh handed over the airstrip to the Ministry of Defence in 
June 2009.The government has proposed to operationalise a civil enclave at the airport.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) had sent a report to the state government and the
 Indian Air Force in July 2011 for the removal of obstacles around the aerodrome for safe 
 flight operations and cited a requirement of seven 
acres of land for the development of the civil enclave.</p>
<h2 class="Daporijo">Daporijo Airport</h2>
<p class="Daporijo">Daporijo Airport (IATA: DEP, ICAO: VEDZ) is located at Daporijo in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India. Daporijo used 
to have scheduled services in the 1980s and early 1990s from Vayudoot. The airport had flights to Guwahati and Dibrugarh on Dornier Do 228 aircraft.
 Currently,there is no scheduled commercial air service to the airport, although the airport is used by the Indian Army. 
The Airports Authority of India (AAI) plans to develop the airport for operation of ATR-42/ATR-72 type of aircraft.</p>
<h2 class="Itanagar">Itanagar Airport</h2>
<p class="Itanagar">Itanagar Airport is a greenfield airport project that will be constructed at Holongi in the Papum 
Pare district of Arunachal Pradesh, India. It is being built by the Airports Authority of India (AAI) over an area of 
320 hectares.When completed, the airport will be able to accommodate narrow-body jets like the Airbus A321 in the first phase.
The project will also include a five-star hotel and convention centre. As of August 2014,
the AAI has completed the Master Plan of the airport and is working on the Detailed Project Report.
The capital of the Orchid state is famous for its historical monuments and museums. The renowned State museum is in Itanagar.
Buddhism spirit is on its fleek with Gompa monastery here. Indira Gandhi Park and science centre can be tourist's attraction as well.
Travelling by car is the most convenient way of travelling in Itanagar.</p>
<h2 class="Pasighat">Pasighat Airport</h2>
<p class="Pasighat">Pasighat Airport or Passighat Airport (IATA: IXT, ICAO: VEPG) is located at Pasighat in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India.
The Airports Authority of India (AAI) operates a civil enclave at Pasighat. A new passenger terminal was built in 2017.A helicopter service
 on behalf of the Arunachal Pradesh government is operated by Pawan Hans between Pasighat and various regional stations.In April 2018,
 an Air India Regional ATR-42 aircraft carried out a test landing at the Pasighat ALG, in preparation for scheduled commercial services under 
 the Regional Connectivity Scheme called UDAN.</p>
 <h2 class="Tezu">Tezu Airport</h2>
 <p class="Tezu">Tezu Airport (IATA: TEI, ICAO: VETJ) is located at Tezu in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India. It is operated by the 
Airports Authority of India (AAI) which is upgrading it to handle ATR 72 type of Aircraft with night-landing facility.
The upgraded airport is expected to be operational by September 2018. Tezu is one of five airports that were shortlisted in 2015 
for the implementation of AAI's "no-frills model", which will provide only 
essential services needed to operationalise the airport, without compromising on safety and security in any way. 
With an aim to ensure low cost of operation, the airport will have no conveyor belts, no aerobridges and only the 
security hold area for departing passengers is likely to be air-conditioned.

The development of the airport, at an estimated cost of Rupees 79 crore, was approved during 2009-10. Extension of runway to 1500 metres,
construction of terminal building and air traffic control tower was to be completed by 2014. However, the project faced multiple delays 
because of protests by local residents and the deadline was missed. Construction works of the runway and ancillary work like boundary walls,
parking lot and drainage system was completed by early 2017. A test flight landed on the runway on 22 September 2017.</p>
<h2 class="Zero">Zero Airport</h2>
<p class="Zero">Zero Airport or Ziro Airport (IATA: ZER, ICAO: VEZO) is located at Ziro in the state of Arunachal Pradesh, India. In the past,Vayudoot
 and Air India used to operate daily flights to the airport. Jet Airways showed interest in flying into the airport from Delhi, but did not commence operations.
 [citation needed]A Pre-feasibility study was conducted by the Ministry of Civil Aviation for improving the airport to enable ATR-42 class aircraft in 2008. 
 The study found it unfeasible to extend the 1220 metre runway to accommodate a 50-seater aircraft, due to unauthorized constructions along the boundary wall. 
 It was proposed that a new runway measuring 2010 metres be built on land adjacent to the current runway and all airport structures like ATC tower,
 fire station and terminal building be relocated.</p>

 <h2 class="Road">Road Ways</h2>

 <h2 class="Roads">East West Industrial Corridor Highway</h2>
 <p class="Road">The East-West Industrial Corridor Highway, Arunachal Pradesh in Arunachal Pradesh India is a road proposed to be built in the 
 foothills of Arunachal Pradesh (marked red).

"Arunachal East-West Corridor" in the foothills along the Assam border, the Trans-Arunachal Highway through the middle and the Arunachal Frontier
 Highway along the China border are 3 major highways spanning 
the whole state, thus enabling the Look East connectivity.
The Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Forum for Regional Cooperation (BCIM Forum) has proposed to build a multi-mode BCIM Economic Corridor 
that includes a highway from China to Bangladesh through Mayanmar and India which is proposed to originate from Kolkata in India's West Bengal 
state to Kunming in China's Yunnan province passing through Dhaka and Chittagong in Bangladesh, India's north-eastern states of Manipur & Assam,
and Myanmar's Mandalay as well as northern provinces.The proposed East-West Industrial Corridor Highway,
Arunachal Pradesh and the Arunachal Frontier Highway would be connected to the BCIM Economic Corridor Highway.
In 2014 October, Kiren Rijiju, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs of India was trying to expedite this project along with another 
proposed highway Arunachal Frontier Highway in Arunachal Pradesh as he said "I am proposing to undertake Arunachal Frontier Highway 
road along with another in the foothill areas of Arunachal Pradesh state from Bhairabkunda in Assam located at the tri-junction of Bhutan,
Assam and Arunachal Pradesh to Ruksin in East Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh state which will serve as an industrial corridor 
for the people residing in the foothill areas of the state".</p>
<h2 class="Roads">Ledo Road</h2>
<p class="Road">
The Ledo Road (from Ledo, Assam, India to Kunming, Yunnan, China) was an overland connection between India and China, built during 
World War II to enable the Western Allies to deliver supplies to China, to aid the war effort against Japan — as an alternative to the Burma Road became 
required, once that had been cut-off by the Japanese in 1942. It was renamed the Stilwell Road, after General Joseph Stilwell of the U.S. Army, in early 1945 
at the suggestion of Chiang Kai-shek. It passes through the Burmese towns of Shingbwiyang, Myitkyina and Bhamo in Kachin state.

In the 19th century, British railway builders had surveyed the Pangsau Pass, which is 1,136 metres (3,727 feet) high on the India-Burma border,
on the Patkai crest, above Nampong, Arunachal Pradesh and Ledo, Tinsukia (part of Assam). They concluded that a track could be pushed through to Burma 
and down the Hukawng Valley. Although the proposal was dropped, the British prospected the Patkai Range for a road from Assam into northern Burma.
British engineers had surveyed the route for a road for the first 130 kilometres (80 miles). After the British had been pushed back out of most of 
Burma by the Japanese, building this road became a priority for the United States. After Rangoon was captured by the Japanese and before the Ledo Road 
was finished, the majority of supplies to the Chinese had to be delivered via airlift over the eastern end of the Himalayan Mountains known as the Hump.

Of the 1,726 kilometres (1,072 mi) long road, 1,033 kilometres (642 mi) is in Burma and 632 kilometres (393 mi) is in China with the remainder in India.

After the war, the road fell into disuse. In 2010, the BBC reported, "Much of the road has been swallowed up by jungle."</p>

<h2 class="Roads">Trans-Arunachal Highway</h2>
<p class="Road">The Trans-Arunachal Highway, also called NH13, is an under upgradation two-lane highway project in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh.
The highway extends from Tawang in the western part of the state to Kanubari in the east covering 1,559 km. The highway will connect 
12 of the existing 16 district headquarters. The remaining 4 districts and the state capital will be connected to the "Trans-Arunachal Highway" 
by link roads which covers another 848 km.Its route will cost Rupees 100,000 million (US$1.4 billion) (c. 2008).

Arunachal Frontier Highway along the China border, "Trans-Arunachal Highway" through the middle and Arunachal East-West Corridor 
in the foothills along the Assam border are 3 major highways spanning the whole state, thus enabling the Look East connectivity.</p>
